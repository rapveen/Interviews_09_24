Abstract Classes:
Advantages:

Code reuse reduces boilerplate.
Establishes strict parent-child relationships, aiding in semantic clarity.
Allows adding default behavior while maintaining extensibility.
Drawbacks:

Lack of flexibility due to single inheritance (in many languages).
Tight coupling between child and parent classes.
Interfaces:
Advantages:

Promotes loose coupling, fostering flexibility.
Allows multiple roles for a single class (e.g., a class can be both Flyable and Swimmable).
Enables clear separation of concerns.
Drawbacks:

No shared behavior, requiring implementing classes to duplicate logic.
Can lead to interface pollution with many small interfaces

A. Scalability:
Interfaces allow for more scalable architectures due to loose coupling and easier extensibility.
Abstract classes may limit flexibility in larger, evolving systems.
B. Maintainability:
Abstract classes simplify maintenance with shared logic centralized.
Interfaces increase maintainability in modular systems with minimal interdependencies.
C. Performance:
Abstract classes might offer better performance due to reduced method lookups (e.g., vtables in C++).
Interfaces can introduce overhead in dynamic dispatch but are negligible in modern systems.
D. Future-Proofing:
Interfaces align well with open/closed principles: adding new behavior is easier without disrupting existing code.
Abstract classes may require careful refactoring as hierarchies deepen.
E. Complexity of System:
Use abstract classes for systems with clear domain hierarchies.
Prefer interfaces for systems requiring high modularity or plugin-like extensibility
