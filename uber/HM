It started with some casual questions about my hobbies.
We then discussed my first company (Paysafe) project in detail for about 30 minutes.
Similarly, we spent 30-40 minutes discussing my current project at Amazon.
The technical part involved designing a stock price notification system that alerts users if a stock price goes up by 10% or hits a static value.
We spent 35 minutes discussing the design, and I had to create a detailed low-level design on the whiteboard.
