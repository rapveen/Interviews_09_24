### Problem Overview

To solve this problem, let’s first understand the statement:

> Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

### Initial Thoughts

If you're familiar with **HashMaps**, you might immediately think of using a HashMap to solve this. And you’re correct! We'll use a HashMap in combination with a **Heap** to achieve this efficiently. If you’re already thinking of a heap-based approach, you’re on the right track, as that leads to the brute-force solution.

---

### Brute Force Approach

Let's break down the brute-force approach with an example.

**Example**:
- **Input**: `nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]`, `k = 2`
- **Output**: `[1, 2]`

To solve this, we’ll perform two main steps:

1. **HashMap**
2. **Heap**

#### Step 1: Build a Frequency Map

- Create a frequency map to count occurrences of each element in `nums`.

```plaintext
nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
--------------------------------
| Element | Frequency          |
|---------|---------------------|
| 1       | 3                   |
| 2       | 2                   |
| 3       | 1                   |
--------------------------------
```

#### Step 2: Use a Max Heap

- Build a Max Heap to prioritize elements by their frequency. The top of the heap will always contain the most frequent elements.
- Once we populate the Max Heap, we extract the top `k` elements.

```plaintext
Max Heap:
---------
| Element |
|---------|
|   1     |
|   2     |
|   3     |
---------

Result Array `res` (top `k` elements):
1. Pop the max element → `res = [1]`
2. Pop the next max element → `res = [1, 2]`
```

Since `k = 2`, we stop here. **Result**: `[1, 2]`

### Java Code for Brute Force Approach

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] topKFrequent(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Step 1: Build Frequency Map
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i : nums) {
            map.put(i, map.getOrDefault(i, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // Step 2: Build Max Heap based on frequencies
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> map.get(b) - map.get(a));
        maxHeap.addAll(map.keySet());

        // Step 3: Extract top K elements from the heap
        int[] res = new int[k];
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            res[i] = maxHeap.poll();
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

### Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(K \log D)\), where \(D\) is the number of distinct elements.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(D)\), the size of the heap.

### Optimized Approach with Bucket Sort

While the previous solution works, we can optimize it further with **Bucket Sort**.

#### What is Bucket Sort?

**Bucket Sort** distributes elements into several "buckets" based on frequency, and then sorts these buckets individually. 

#### Steps for Bucket Sort

1. **Create Frequency Map**:
   - Iterate through `nums`, building a map of each element's frequency.

2. **Create Bucket List**:
   - Use an array of lists where the index represents the frequency.
   - For each frequency in the map, add the element at the corresponding bucket index.

3. **Collect Results**:
   - Traverse the bucket array from the end to gather the `k` most frequent elements.

### Summary

- **Brute Force**: We used a HashMap and a Max Heap to get the `k` most frequent elements.
- **Optimized Approach**: We used Bucket Sort to achieve a more efficient solution.

**Time Complexity**: Bucket Sort reduces complexity and can be more efficient for high-frequency distributions.

Hope this helps clarify the approach and code for finding the `k` most frequent elements!
