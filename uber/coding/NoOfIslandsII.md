I'll help you solve this problem using the systematic approach outlined:

### 1. ANALYSIS

**Requirements/Constraints:**
- Input: 
  - Grid dimensions m x n (1 ≤ m,n ≤ 10^4)
  - Array of positions to add land
  - Total grid size m*n ≤ 10^4
  - positions[i] is valid: 0 ≤ ri < m, 0 ≤ ci < n
- Output:
  - Array of integers where answer[i] = number of islands after ith operation
- Time complexity requirement: O(k log(mn)) where k = positions.length

**Key Points That Could Be Missed:**
- Grid starts empty (all water)
- Positions might overlap (add land to same cell multiple times)
- Islands form by connecting horizontally/vertically only (not diagonally)
- Need to return count after EACH operation
- All edges are surrounded by water

**Most Complex Test Case:**
```
m=3, n=3, positions=[[0,0],[0,1],[1,2],[2,1]]
This case shows:
- Islands merging
- Multiple separate islands
- Non-sequential land addition
```

### 2. DRY RUN

**Pattern Analysis:**
```
Initially: 0 0 0    After (0,0):  1 0 0    After (0,1):  1 1 0
          0 0 0                   0 0 0                   0 0 0
          0 0 0                   0 0 0                   0 0 0
Count: 0          Count: 1              Count: 1

After (1,2):  1 1 0    After (2,1):  1 1 0
              0 0 1                   0 0 1
              0 0 0                   0 1 0
Count: 2            Count: 3
```

**Key Observations:**
1. Need to check 4 adjacent cells when adding land
2. Islands can merge when new land connects them
3. Need efficient way to track connected components

**Edge Cases:**
1. Single cell grid
2. Adding land to same position twice
3. Full grid of land
4. Positions that create bridge between islands

### 3. APPROACH

**Data Structures:**
- Union-Find (Disjoint Set) for tracking connected islands
- Boolean grid to track land cells
- Time: O(k log(mn)) using Union-Find with path compression
- Space: O(mn) for grid and Union-Find structure

**Core Algorithm:**
1. Union-Find operations for efficient island tracking
2. Use 2D to 1D mapping for cell positions

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. Initialize Union-Find structure and grid
2. For each position:
   - If already land, use previous count
   - Mark as land
   - Check 4 adjacent cells
   - Union with any adjacent land
   - Count unique island roots
3. Return counts array


The solution meets all requirements:
1. Time Complexity: O(k log(mn)) using Union-Find with path compression
2. Space Complexity: O(mn) for grid and Union-Find structures
3. Handles all edge cases:
   - Duplicate positions
   - Single cell grid
   - Bridge formations
   - Out of bounds checks

Key implementation features:
1. Uses Union-Find with path compression and rank for optimal performance
2. Maintains a boolean grid for quick land checking
3. Includes comprehensive test cases
4. Well-commented for maintainability
5. Modular design with separate UnionFind class

Time complexity:
Let me break down the time complexity analysis step by step:

1) First, let's define the variables:
- k = number of positions (length of positions array)
- m, n = grid dimensions
- α(N) = inverse Ackermann function (grows extremely slowly, effectively constant)

2) Let's analyze each component:

**Initialization Cost:**
```java
UnionFind uf = new UnionFind(m * n);
boolean[][] grid = new boolean[m][n];
```
- UnionFind initialization: O(m*n)
- Grid initialization: O(m*n)
- Initial cost: O(m*n)

**For each position (k iterations):**

A) Basic Operations per Position:
```java
grid[row][col] = true;  // O(1)
count++;                 // O(1)
```

B) Checking Adjacent Cells (4 directions):
```java
for (int[] dir : DIRECTIONS) {  // 4 iterations
    int newRow = row + dir[0];
    int newCol = col + dir[1];
    // boundary checks...
}
```
- Constant work (4 iterations) = O(1)

C) Union-Find Operations per Adjacent Land:
```java
if (uf.find(pos1D) != uf.find(newPos1D)) {
    uf.union(pos1D, newPos1D);
    count--;
}
```
Let's analyze Union-Find operations:

1. find() operation:
   - With path compression: O(α(N)) where N = m*n
   - α(N) is the inverse Ackermann function
   - Effectively constant time, but technically O(α(N))

2. union() operation:
   - Uses find() twice plus constant work
   - With union by rank: O(α(N))

So for each direction that has land:
- Two find() operations: 2*O(α(N))
- One potential union() operation: O(α(N))
- Total per direction: O(α(N))

Total Cost Analysis:
1) Initial setup: O(m*n)
2) For each of k positions:
   - Basic operations: O(1)
   - Check 4 directions: O(1)
   - For each direction (max 4):
     - Union-Find operations: O(α(N))
   - Total per position: O(α(N))

Therefore:
```
Total Time = O(m*n) + k * O(α(N))
           = O(m*n) + O(k * α(mn))
```

Since α(mn) is effectively constant and m*n ≤ 10^4 (from constraints):
```
Total Time ≈ O(k)
```

However, to be theoretically precise:
```
Total Time = O(k * log*(mn))
```
where log* is the iterative logarithm (grows even slower than log).

The problem asked for O(k log(mn)), and our solution is actually better than that because:
```
log*(mn) < log(mn)
```

**Space Complexity:**
- UnionFind arrays (parent, rank): O(m*n)
- Grid: O(m*n)
- Result array: O(k)
Total Space: O(m*n + k)

**Optimality:**
This solution is optimal because:
1. We must at least read all k positions: Ω(k)
2. We need to track the state of the grid: Ω(m*n)
3. The Union-Find operations give us the best possible time for dynamically tracking connected components

The Union-Find data structure with both path compression and union by rank is crucial for achieving this complexity. Without these optimizations:
- Without path compression: O(k log(mn))
- Without union by rank: O(k mn)
- Without both: O(k mn)

Therefore, this solution achieves better than the required O(k log(mn)) time complexity while being space optimal.
