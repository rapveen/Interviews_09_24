1. ANALYSIS
```
Requirements/Constraints:
- Array of words: length 1 to 100
- Each word length: 1 to 20
- Order string: exactly 26 characters
- All chars are lowercase English letters
- Need to verify lexicographical sorting
- Shorter strings come before longer strings if prefix matches

Key points easily missed:
- Empty character (end of string) is less than any letter
- Need to handle common prefixes
- Order string defines relative ordering of ALL letters
- Each letter appears exactly once in order

Most complex test case: Example 3 ["apple","app"]
- Requires handling string length comparison
- Common prefix with different lengths
```

2. DRY RUN
```
Example: ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Compare "word" vs "world":
- 'w' matches
- 'o' matches
- 'r' matches
- 'd' matches vs 'l'
- Since 'd' comes after 'l' in order => not sorted

Edge cases:
- Single word array
- Empty strings (not possible per constraints)
- All same characters ["aaa","aaa"]
- Completely different words ["xyz","abc"]
- Common prefixes with different lengths
```

3. APPROACH
```
Data structures:
- HashMap to store letter rankings from order string

Algorithm:
1. Create mapping of each letter to its rank in order string
2. For each consecutive pair of words:
   a) Compare characters at same positions
   b) If characters different, check their ranks
   c) If ranks wrong order, return false
   d) If one string ends, check lengths
3. If all comparisons pass, return true

Time complexity: O(N*M) where N=total chars in all words, M=max word length
Space complexity: O(1) as HashMap always has 26 entries
```
Verification:
1. ["hello","leetcode"] = true ✓
2. ["word","world","row"] = false ✓
3. ["apple","app"] = false ✓

Constraints met:
- Handles all valid word array lengths
- Handles all valid word lengths
- Uses exactly 26-character order string
- Properly handles lowercase letters only
- Time complexity O(N*M) is efficient
- Space complexity O(1) is optimal
