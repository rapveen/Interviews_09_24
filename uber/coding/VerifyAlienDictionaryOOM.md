If the order string is too large for memory, we need to modify our approach. Here's the analysis:

1. ANALYSIS
```
Modified constraints/requirements:
- Order string too large for memory
- Still need O(n*m) comparison time complexity
- Can't use HashMap for full order string
- Need streaming/chunked processing

Key modification needed:
- Instead of storing full order string, process character rankings in chunks
- Or use alternative comparison method without storing full order
```

2. APPROACH
```
Two possible approaches:

Approach 1 - Binary Search in Order String:
- Instead of storing rankings, search in order string
- Cons: Multiple searches needed, I/O heavy
- Not efficient for large order string

Approach 2 - Two-Pass Streaming (Better):
- Only store characters needed for current words
- Build partial ranking map for required characters only
```

Key improvements:
1. Memory efficient:
   - Only stores rankings for characters actually used in words
   - Processes order string in chunks
   - Memory usage proportional to unique chars in words

2. Still maintains efficiency:
   - Time complexity: O(N*M) for word comparisons
   - Space complexity: O(K) where K = unique chars in words

3. Handles constraints:
   - Can process arbitrarily large order strings
   - Works with streaming input
   - Maintains correctness of original solution

4. Trade-offs:
   - Slightly more complex code
   - Additional I/O operations
   - Need to tune CHUNK_SIZE based on memory constraints

This solution is more robust for production environments where memory constraints are a concern.
