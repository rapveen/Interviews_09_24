Let me explain the approach in simple terms that you could discuss with an interviewer:

### Initial Problem Understanding
"Let me first explain how I understand the problem:
- We need to find max sum of k-length subarrays
- Elements in subarray must be unique
- Must be contiguous elements"

### Approach Explanation

1. **Basic Idea**
```
"Let me explain the core idea:
- Instead of fixed sliding window, we'll use a flexible window
- When we hit a duplicate, we'll shrink window from start until duplicate is removed
- Once window reaches size k, we check for max sum"
```

2. **Why Deque + HashSet?**
```
"I chose these data structures because:
- Deque: 
  - Need to remove elements from front when duplicate found
  - Need to add elements at end for new elements
  - Perfect for this sliding behavior
- HashSet:
  - Quick O(1) lookup for duplicates
  - Easy to maintain unique elements"
```

3. **Step-by-Step Process**
```
"Let me walk through how we process each element:

Step 1: For each new element we see:
- Check if it's a duplicate in our current window
- If not, just add it
- If yes, we need to handle the duplicate

Step 2: Handling duplicates:
- Keep removing elements from front of window
- Until our new element is no longer a duplicate
- Update sum and HashSet accordingly

Step 3: Adding new element:
- Add to back of Deque
- Add to HashSet
- Add to running sum

Step 4: Check window size:
- If we hit size k, we have a valid window
- Update max sum if current sum is larger
- Remove front element to maintain size
```

4. **Example Walkthrough**
```
"Let's take example [9,9,9,1,2,3], k=3:

Initially: []
After 9: [9]
After second 9:
- Duplicate found!
- Remove first 9
- Add second 9: [9]
After third 9:
- Same process
- Window: [9]
After 1: [9,1]
After 2: [9,1,2]
- Size = k = 3, check sum (12)
- Remove 9: [1,2]
After 3: [1,2,3]
- Size = k = 3, check sum (6)

Maximum sum found: 12"
```

5. **Edge Cases**
```
"Let's discuss how we handle edge cases:

1. k > array length:
   - Return 0 immediately
   
2. All duplicates:
   - Window will never reach size k
   - Returns 0 correctly

3. No duplicates:
   - Works like normal sliding window
   
4. k = 1:
   - Works fine, returns max element"
```

6. **Complexity Analysis**
```
"Let me explain the complexity:

Time: O(n) because:
- Each element enters deque once
- Each element can exit deque once
- All operations (add/remove) are O(1)

Space: O(k) because:
- Deque never grows beyond k
- HashSet never grows beyond k"
```

Let me analyze your Deque implementation. This is actually a very clever approach!

### Analysis of Your Implementation:

**Key Advantages of Your Deque Approach:**
1. Handles duplicates more elegantly
2. Dynamically adjusts window size when duplicates found
3. No need for frequency counting
4. More efficient when there are many duplicates



1. **Dynamic Window Handling:**
   ```java
   while (duplicate.contains(nums[i])) {
       int out = dq.pollFirst();
       // ... cleanup ...
   }
   ```
   - Automatically adjusts window when duplicate found
   - More efficient than checking entire window

2. **Natural Flow:**
   - Elements flow through the deque naturally
   - No need to track frequencies
   - Simpler to understand the flow of elements

3. **Efficient Duplicate Handling:**
   - Immediately removes elements until duplicate is resolved
   - Don't need to wait for window to slide
   - Better for cases with many duplicates


**When This Approach Is Particularly Good:**

1. Many duplicate elements in array
2. When duplicates are close together
3. When we need to dynamically adjust window size
4. When order of elements matters


7. **Why This is Optimal**
```
"This approach is optimal because:
1. We never need to rescan elements
2. We handle duplicates immediately
3. We maintain minimal required space
4. We do exactly one pass through array"
```

8. **Alternative Approaches**
```
"We could have used:
1. HashMap with frequencies
2. Regular sliding window
But these would be:
- More complex to implement
- Less efficient for duplicate handling
- Harder to understand"
```

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide more specific examples?
