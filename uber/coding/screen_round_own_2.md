It is a well-known fact that Mr. Krabs owns a very popular restaurant, known as the Krusty Krab. He makes a lot of money from his restaurant, and all day long he's only counting his money. Not satisfied with his billions, he also opened an amusement park, called Krustyland, which contains lots of famous attractions, like roller coasters and ferris wheels. Recently, he has decided to open a haunted house. It is the scariest haunted house ever! In fact, it is so scary, that most people don't even want to go inside alone.
There are N people who want to visit the haunted house. The ith person will only go if at least Li other people will go with him. Additionally, that person doesn't want to go with more than Hi other people, since it would ruin the experience for them
What is the maximum number of people that can visit the haunted house at one time so that no constraint is violated?

Sample Input

6＜-N - no .of people

(Li, Hi)
1 2
1 4
0 3
01
3 4
0 2

Sample Output -
3


The solution can be optimized by avoiding binary search. Let's think differently:

OPTIMIZATION INSIGHT:
- For each person i, we know their valid group size range: [Li+1, Hi+1]
- At any valid answer k, we need exactly k people who can participate in a group of size k
- We can sort people by their ranges and find exact valid points

OPTIMIZED APPROACH:
Data Structure: Two arrays to store events (range endpoints)
Algorithm: Line Sweep / Event Processing
Steps:
1. Create entry/exit events for each person's valid range
2. Process events in sorted order to find valid points

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public static int maxGroupSize(int N, int[] L, int[] H) {
        // Create events array: (point, isEntry)
        int[][] events = new int[2*N][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            // Add entry point (L[i] + 1 because person needs L[i] others)
            events[2*i] = new int[]{L[i] + 1, 1};
            // Add exit point (H[i] + 1 because range includes self)
            events[2*i + 1] = new int[]{H[i] + 1, -1};
        }
        
        // Sort events by point
        Arrays.sort(events, (a, b) -> a[0] == b[0] ? a[1] - b[1] : a[0] - b[0]);
        
        int currentPeople = 0;
        int maxValid = 0;
        
        // Process events
        for (int[] event : events) {
            currentPeople += event[1];
            // If current point has enough people who can form a group of this size
            if (currentPeople >= event[0]) {
                maxValid = Math.max(maxValid, event[0]);
            }
        }
        
        return maxValid;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test case
        int N = 6;
        int[] L = {1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0};
        int[] H = {2, 4, 3, 1, 4, 2};
        
        System.out.println(maxGroupSize(N, L, H));  // Output: 3
    }
}

```

TIME COMPLEXITY: O(N log N)
- Only for sorting events
- Processing events is O(N)

SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(N)
- For storing events array

While asymptotic complexity remains same, this solution:
1. Eliminates binary search overhead
2. Processes each constraint exactly once
3. More efficient in practice due to simpler operations
4. Provides actual valid group size directly

This is optimal as we must at least look at all constraints once (Ω(N)) and need some form of ordering (Ω(N log N)).


dry run
Entry points (Li+1): [2,2,1,1,4,1]
Exit points (Hi+1):  [3,5,4,2,5,3]
Combined & Sorted:   [(1,+1), (1,+1), (1,+1), (2,+1), (2,-1), (3,-1), (3,-1), (4,-1), (5,-1), (5,-1)]

Point 1: count=3  (3≥1) → maxValid=1
Point 2: count=4  (4≥2) → maxValid=2
Point 2: count=3  (3≥2) → maxValid=2
Point 3: count=1  (1≥3) → maxValid=2
Point 3: count=0  (0≥3) → maxValid=2
Point 4: count=-1 (-1≥4) → maxValid=2
Point 5: count=-3 (-3≥5) → maxValid=2
