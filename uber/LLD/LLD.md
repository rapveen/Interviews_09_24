1. **Variation of Key Value storage. And some Transaction handling. Design LLD and code**
2. **Question was a variation of meeting scheduler.**
    N rooms are given and streams of times will be given and we have to schedule meeting. After storing the meeting we have to store audit logs for each room. We have to delete audit logs after x days. Follow up questions were that rooms will have capactiy constraints so that we have to check if we can organise meeting with given capacity. Also we have to minimise spillage of free time while sceduling meetings.
    Spillage eg: if room1 is free from 9-10 am and room2 is free from 9am - 12pm and if a meeting comes for 9-10 am then we should assign it to room1 as room1 will be booked for day . Concurrency handling was expected.


    After clearing above rounds HLD and HM were scheduled.
