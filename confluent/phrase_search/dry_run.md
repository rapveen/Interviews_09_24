**Phrase:** `"fox was very quick"`

**Steps:**

1. **Normalization:**
   - Convert to lowercase and remove punctuation.
   - **Normalized Phrase:** `"fox was very quick"`

2. **Retrieve Postings Lists:**
   - `"fox"`: Document 3, Positions [3]
   - `"was"`: Document 3, Positions [4]
   - `"very"`: Document 3, Positions [6, 8]
   - `"quick"`: Document 3, Positions [1, 5]

3. **Identify Common Documents:**
   - All words are present in **Document 3**.

4. **Phrase Verification:**
   
   **a. Iterate Over Positions of the First Word (`"fox"`):**
   
   - **First Word Positions (`firstWordPositions`):** [3]
   
   - **For `pos = 3`:**
     
     **i. Check `"was"` at `pos + 1 = 4`:**
     
     - **`currentWordPositions` for `"was"`:** [4]
     - **Binary Search:** `Collections.binarySearch([4], 4)` returns `0` (found).
     
     **ii. Check `"very"` at `pos + 2 = 5`:**
     
     - **`currentWordPositions` for `"very"`:** [6, 8]
     - **Binary Search:** `Collections.binarySearch([6, 8], 5)` returns `-1` (not found).
     
     **Result:**
     
     - Since `"very"` is **not** found at position `5`, the phrase `"fox was very quick"` does **not** exist starting at position `3`.
