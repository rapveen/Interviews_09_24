Let me solve this systematically following the given approach.

1. INITIAL ANALYSIS
- Space/Time constraints: Given the small input sizes (≤10 pairs, words ≤10 chars), space/time optimization might not be critical
- Need to optimize for generating all possible combinations while maintaining lexicographical order
- Questions for clarity:
  - Are synonym relationships transitive? (Based on Example 1, yes: happy→joy→cheerful)
  - Are words case-sensitive? (Based on examples, appears lowercase)
  - Can a word have multiple synonym groups? (Based on examples, no)

2. REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS
- Full requirements:
  * Build groups of synonym words considering transitive relationships
  * Split input text into words
  * For each word that has synonyms, generate all possible combinations
  * Sort results lexicographically
  * Maintain original text structure (spaces, non-synonym words)
- Key points easily missed:
  * Transitive relationships (happy→joy→cheerful all mean same)
  * Word positions must stay same, only synonyms can be swapped
  * Final sorting needs to be lexicographical
- Most complex test case: Example 1 with multiple synonym groups and transitive relationships

3. SOLUTION BRAINSTORMING
Approaches:
1. Brute Force:
   - Build direct mapping for each word to its synonyms
   - Generate all combinations
   - Time: O(k^n) where k is max synonyms per word, n is words
   - Space: O(k^n) for storing all combinations

2. Graph + DFS (Optimal):
   - Use graph to build connected components (synonym groups)
   - DFS to find all words in each group
   - Generate combinations using these groups
   - Time: O(N*M) for graph building + O(k^n) for combinations
   - Space: O(N) for graph, where N is total unique words

Choose Graph+DFS as it handles transitive relationships better.

4. DRY RUN
Complex example: synonyms = [["happy","joy"],["sad","sorrow"],["joy","cheerful"]]
text = "I am happy today but was sad yesterday"

Graph building:
happy ─── joy ─── cheerful
sad ─── sorrow

Groups formed:
Group1: [cheerful, happy, joy]
Group2: [sad, sorrow]

5. DETAILED APPROACH
1. Build Graph and Find Groups:
   - Create undirected graph using HashMap<String, Set<String>>
   - Use DFS to find connected components (synonym groups)
   - Store groups in HashMap<String, List<String>>

2. Process Text:
   - Split text into words
   - For each word:
     * If word has synonyms, get its group
     * Generate combinations using group words
   - Combine results maintaining original structure
   - Sort lexicographically

Time Complexity: O(N*M) for graph + O(k^n) for combinations
Space Complexity: O(N) for graph + O(k^n) for results


This solution handles all the requirements and edge cases:
1. Transitive relationships through graph building and DFS
2. Lexicographical ordering by sorting synonym groups and final results
3. Input validation through proper data structure initialization
4. Memory efficiency by using StringBuilder for combination generation
5. Modular design with separate methods for each major step

Example test cases are handled correctly:
```java
// Test Case 1
synonyms = [["happy","joy"],["sad","sorrow"],["joy","cheerful"]]
text = "I am happy today but was sad yesterday"
// All 6 combinations generated and sorted

// Test Case 2
synonyms = [["happy","joy"],["cheerful","glad"]]
text = "I am happy today but was sad yesterday"
// 2 combinations generated and sorted
```

The solution maintains clarity through:
- Clear method names and organization
- Detailed comments explaining key steps
- Proper separation of concerns (graph building, DFS, combination generation)
- Efficient data structures for each operation
