Let me solve this systematically:

1. INITIAL ANALYSIS
- Constraints: Small string length (≤20) but large dictionary (≤1000)
- Need to optimize for word lookup operations
- Need to find ALL possible combinations
- Questions for clarity:
  - Can words be reused? (Yes, per note)
  - Are overlapping words allowed? (Yes, per examples)
  - Does order of results matter? (No, any order)

2. REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS
- Requirements:
  * Break string into valid dictionary words
  * Return all possible combinations
  * Handle overlapping words
  * Each word must be in dictionary
  * Handle case when no solution exists
- Key points easily missed:
  * Same word can be reused
  * Need to check entire string (no leftover characters)
  * Overlapping substrings need different combinations
- Most complex case: Example 2 with overlapping words

3. SOLUTION BRAINSTORMING
1. Brute Force Recursion:
   - Try each possible word at each position
   - Time: O(2^n) where n is string length
   - Space: O(n) recursion depth

2. Dynamic Programming + Backtracking (Optimal):
   - Use HashSet for O(1) word lookup
   - DP to cache intermediate results
   - Time: O(n * 2^n) worst case
   - Space: O(n) for recursion + O(n) for cache

Choose DP + Backtracking due to optimal lookup and memoization benefits.

4. DRY RUN
Complex example: "pineapplepenapple"
- Start: "pine" -> "apple" -> "pen" -> "apple"
        "pineapple" -> "pen" -> "apple"
        "pine" -> "applepen" -> "apple"

Edge cases:
- No solution exists
- Single character words
- All possible prefixes are valid
- Empty dictionary
- String length = 1

5. DETAILED APPROACH
1. Preprocessing:
   - Convert dictionary to HashSet for O(1) lookup
   
2. Main algorithm (DP + Backtracking):
   - Use memoization to cache results for each starting index
   - At each position, try all possible prefixes that are valid words
   - Recursively solve remaining substring
   - Combine results with current word


This solution handles all requirements and edge cases:
1. Uses HashSet for O(1) word lookup
2. Memoization prevents redundant computations
3. Handles overlapping words correctly
4. Returns empty list when no solution exists
5. Properly combines words with spaces

Test case verification:
```java
// Test Case 1
s = "catsanddog"
wordDict = ["cat","cats","and","sand","dog"]
// Output: ["cats and dog","cat sand dog"]

// Test Case 2
s = "pineapplepenapple"
wordDict = ["apple","pen","applepen","pine","pineapple"]
// Output: ["pine apple pen apple","pineapple pen apple","pine applepen apple"]

// Test Case 3
s = "catsandog"
wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
// Output: []

// Edge Cases
s = "a"
wordDict = ["a"]
// Output: ["a"]

s = "aaaa"
wordDict = ["a"]
// Output: ["a a a a"]
```

Complexity Analysis:
- Time: O(n * 2^n) worst case where n is string length
  * Each position can be either a word break or not
  * Need to construct all possible combinations
- Space: O(n) for recursion stack + O(n) for memoization
  * Memoization stores results for each starting position

The solution is optimal for the given constraints because:
1. Uses memoization to avoid redundant computations
2. HashSet provides O(1) word lookup
3. Builds solutions incrementally
4. Handles all edge cases efficiently
5. Meets space/time requirements within constraints

Further optimizations possible but not necessary given constraints:
1. Pre-check if string contains invalid characters
2. Build trie for dictionary (overkill given constraints)
3. Add length-based pruning for dictionary words
