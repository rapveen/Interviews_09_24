Let me solve this systematically following the given approach.

1. INITIAL ANALYSIS
- Space/Time constraints: Small input size (n ≤ 100, length ≤ 20)
- Need to optimize for finding shortest unique substrings
- Need to maintain lexicographical order when multiple options exist
- Questions for clarity:
  - Do we need to consider overlapping substrings? (Yes, based on examples)
  - Are empty strings allowed in input? (No, specified as non-empty)
  - Are duplicate strings allowed in input? (Not specified, assume no based on examples)

2. REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS
- Requirements:
  * Find shortest substring unique to each string
  * If multiple shortest exist, choose lexicographically smallest
  * Return empty string if no unique substring exists
  * Handle overlapping substrings
  * Process all possible substring lengths
- Key points easily missed:
  * Substring should be completely unique (not present in ANY other string)
  * Need to check ALL possible substrings of each length
  * Lexicographically smallest among shortest
- Most complex case: Example 1 with multiple possible answers



This solution handles all requirements and edge cases:
1. Processes strings incrementally by length
2. Maintains lexicographical ordering
3. Returns empty string when no unique substring exists
4. Handles overlapping substrings
5. Input validation included




1. INITIAL ANALYSIS (Updated)
- Can precompute all substrings and store in HashSets for O(1) lookup
- Can build a global set of all substrings to check uniqueness faster
- Critical optimization: Only need to store substrings up to length 20

2. REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS (Updated)
- Same requirements as before
- Additional optimization requirements:
  * Minimize repeated substring computations
  * Optimize substring existence checking
  * Efficient storage of substrings

3. SOLUTION BRAINSTORMING (New Approaches)
3. SOLUTION BRAINSTORMING
Approaches:
1. Brute Force:
   - Generate all substrings for each string
   - Check each against all other strings
   - Time: O(n * m^3) where m is max string length
   - Space: O(m^2) for substrings

2. Optimized Approach:
   - Start with shortest possible length (1)
   - For each length, generate and check substrings
   - Stop when found for each string
   - Time: O(n * m^2 * n) = O(n^2 * m^2)
   - Space: O(m) for substrings

1. HashSet Approach:
   - Precompute all substrings for each string into HashSets
   - Build global set of all substrings
   - Time: O(n * m^2) for preprocessing + O(n * m^2) for finding
   - Space: O(n * m^2) for all substrings

2. Trie Approach:
   - Build trie with all substrings
   - Mark string indices where each substring occurs
   - Time: O(n * m^2) for building + O(m) for searching
   - Space: O(n * m^2) for trie nodes

Choose HashSet Approach as it's simpler to implement and has similar complexity.

4. DRY RUN (Updated)
Input: arr = ["cab","ad","bad","c"]

Pre-processing:
String "cab": {"c", "a", "b", "ca", "ab", "cab"}
String "ad": {"a", "d", "ad"}
String "bad": {"b", "a", "d", "ba", "ad", "bad"}
String "c": {"c"}

5. DETAILED APPROACH (Optimized)
1. Preprocessing phase:
   - Create HashSet for each string's substrings
   - Create global HashSet for quick lookup
   - Track which string each substring belongs to

2. Finding unique substrings:
   - For each length (ascending)
   - Check substrings against global set
   - Track shortest unique substring

Here's the optimized solution:

Key Optimizations:
1. Substring Precomputing:
   - All substrings computed once and stored with their string indices
   - O(1) lookup time for checking substring existence
   - Space tradeoff for better time complexity

2. Early Termination:
   - Stop as soon as shortest unique substring is found
   - Use TreeSet for automatic lexicographical ordering

3. Memory Optimization:
   - Only store necessary information in the HashMap
   - Use Set<Integer> to track string indices efficiently

Time Complexity Analysis:
- Preprocessing: O(n * m^2) for generating all substrings
- Finding unique substrings: O(n * m^2) worst case
- Overall: O(n * m^2) but with much better average case performance

Space Complexity:
- O(n * m^2) for storing all substrings and their occurrences
- Additional O(m) for temporary substring storage

The optimized solution is particularly effective when:
1. There are many repeated substrings across strings
2. Unique substrings are found at shorter lengths
3. Multiple queries need to be processed on the same array

I've also included a Trie-based approach skeleton that could be used for further optimization if needed, especially for:
- Longer strings
- More frequent queries
- Memory is less constrained than time

Sample test verification:
```java
// Test Case 1
arr = ["cab","ad","bad","c"]
// Output: ["ab","","ba",""]
// Much faster as substrings computed only once

// Test Case 2
arr = ["abc","bcd","abcd"]
// Output: ["","","abcd"]
// Better performance due to substring lookup optimization
```

The tradeoff between the original and optimized solution:
- Original: Better space complexity, simpler code
- Optimized: Better time complexity, more complex code but better for repeated operations

Given the constraints (n ≤ 100, length ≤ 20), this optimization provides significant improvement for average cases while maintaining reasonable space usage.
