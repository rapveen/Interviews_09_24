coding round:
    went well
    slightly didn't hear the interviewer hints and solved
HLD round:
    as he is also in payments domain he shown clear details related to mentioning double payments
    he is going to put lot of info consolidatively as well
    But I went in bulding a complex HLD for simple requirements.
    That is unnecessary
Integration round:
    1st Q taken 30mins, which could have been avoided.
    But able to solve rest of them very quickly.
    So good
Bug Squash round:
    Unable to debug at all,
    I couldn't justify why my assumptions are correct.
