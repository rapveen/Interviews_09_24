started with Part -1 Q.
have issue with file path ```ride-simple.json```. I'd the file in a child folder but  I'm running python file from parent folder.
After 10mins I updated my python exec path to child folder.
then it worked.

After that worked on part-2, Pratzz said instead of claude GPT gave very simplistic and good answer.

part-3a also implemented. You can refer from the bikemap folder readme.md
