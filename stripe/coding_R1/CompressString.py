Q - PART 1 :
Given a String, split it into major parts separated by special char / (slash).
For each major part thatâ€™s split by /, we can further split it into minor parts separated by . (dot).


We assume the given Strings:


Only have lower case letters and two separators (., /).
Have no empty minor parts (no leading / trailing separators or consecutive separators like "/a", "a/", "./..").
Have >= 3 letters in each minor part.
Produce a final output String such that for each minor part, we only keep the first and last letter of it, interpolated with the count of letters in between.


Function to implement :


String compress_part_one(String s) {
return compressed_s;
}


## Examples

Given input =>

Q - PART 2

For example, imagine compressing a URL such as "section/how.to.write.a.java.program.in.one.day".
After compressing it by following the rules in Part 1, the second major part still has 9 minor parts after compression.


Task: Therefore, to further compress the String, we want to only keep at most m (m>0) compressed minor parts from Part 1 within each major part.


If a major part has more than m minor parts, we keep the first (m-1) minor parts as is,
but concatenate the first letter of the m-th minor part and the last letter of the last minor part with the count of letters in the original string.
This means that if you build on top of results that have numeronyms, you should expand
on the numbers to count the number or letters in the original String, e.g, "w1w.s4e.c1m"
should be compressed into "w10m" instead of "w7m" (go through the examples below). You can either reuse Part 1 output or not.
If a major part has less than or equal to m minor parts, keep all the individual minor parts as they are from Part 1.


Example :
Given:
str = stripe.com/payments/checkout/customer.maria.doe
minor_parts = 2


(after Part 1 compression)
=>
s4e.c1m/p6s/c6t/c6r.m3a.d1e


(then after Part 2 compression)
=>
s4e.c1m/p6s/c6t/c6r.m6e


Step-by-step guide for part 2 compression:


For the last major part "c6r.m3a.d1e", keep the first 2-1=1 minor part "c6r"
For the rest of the minor parts "m3a.d1e", compress into "m6e"
Combine "c6r.m6e" (from step 1 and 2) as the last compressed major part
Do the same for the rest of the major parts (if applicable)
