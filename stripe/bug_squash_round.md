find a bug in a massively-parallel graph-processing library that was written by a faang company

instructions:
The first thing you would do is to read the description of the problem and the example that can reproduce the issue (if exist). So I did that and then jumped in running the relevant test that would fail. I did some debugging using breakpoints and tracking the execution of test and narrowed down the line causing the issue.
Important to point out that the interviewer was a great help in this test and made a few good comments and acted like a colleague who knows about the code base that is totally new to you.
