1st round is (Hire)
    - able to implement nearly optimal solution
    - articulation of thought process is well
    - handled followup questions

2nd round (Weak Hire)
    - there are some positives  and negatives
    - quick to understand the problem
    - came up with the solution for most part of the question worked.
    - Have good familiarity with java as well
    - solution addressed some edge cases but couldn't cover all of the edgecases
    - They are saying that I didn't realize them when interviewer are trying to give those hints with some examples that would trigger one.
    - there is some gap in appending a list to a string required iterating over it.and it is not an O(1) complexity.
    - Didn't consider the cost of appending a list in each iteration.
    - the time complexity is inherently become O(N^3) due to the repeated inclusion of list
    - interviewer prompted queried to look more upon appending the active list. And I missed that nudge and you are concerned about the length of names instead. so after may be like a few 10mins or so I realized this.
3rd Round (Weak Hire)
    - managed to solve the problem in optimal way
    - however there was a lot of time that required to understanding the assumptions that I'm making.
    - I translated the solution into code but the code was overly complicated.
    - 

I'm completely on track for most of the problem in 2nd & 3rd interviews but probably needed like some nudges from the interviewer.
    - figure out the edgecases
    - figure out the SC & TC for the optimal solution in the limited time we have.
And if you could work on it, I think you can perform better probably the next time around so.

Wait for 3 months or so around March, we can restart the process for me.
