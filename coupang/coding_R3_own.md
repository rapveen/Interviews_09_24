He looks very chill
Kind of not caring what I'm saying. on and off cam sometimes

### if booking is done form india, or booking from US, can you give the complete request flow, how it works, like say the complete flow
Technical Considerations and Trade-offs
Regional Partitioning:

Advantage: Reduces latency for users by ensuring data is closer to the region.
Trade-off: Cross-region bookings (e.g., user in India booking a US hotel) may introduce higher latency.
Caching:

Advantage: Speeds up repeated availability checks for the same hotel.
Trade-off: Requires robust cache invalidation mechanisms to prevent stale data issues.
Distributed Locks:

Advantage: Prevents double booking with high concurrency.
Trade-off: Adds overhead in managing lock timeouts and failure scenarios.
Payment Reliability:

Advantage: Decoupling payments via webhooks ensures booking system does not block on gateway responses.
Trade-off: Requires idempotent operations to avoid double booking on retries.


### when is nosql preferred, any reasons to use document db
-> Ive mentioned we will be using NoSQL DB for Inventory and reservations table. As high write volume is expected it will be easier I mentioned.
-> Again I've done some research about it and written in onenote page -> e-commerce

### for booking, optimistic locks - how are they implemented, if people booking from multiple locations like How the optimistic locking is implemented in case of distributed transactions of people in multiple regions? same room booking by multiple people in different regions

Versioning Field:

Each room record includes a version number or timestamp (e.g., version_id).
When a user attempts a booking, the transaction reads the current version_id, performs the update (mark room as booked), and increments the version_id.
Update Validation:

The write operation includes a conditional update clause (e.g., UPDATE ... WHERE version_id = current_version_id).
If the version_id has changed since the transaction started (another booking was completed in another region), the update fails, and the transaction retries with the new data.
Distributed Conflict Resolution:

For cross-region consistency, distributed databases like DynamoDB or CockroachDB use quorum-based writes or consensus protocols (e.g., Paxos or Raft) to handle conflicts.
Write contention is managed by re-attempting failed updates or falling back to compensating transactions to release locked inventory.


### do you think optimistic lock will work for this case system design? if you think it works, why do you think it works?
Here's the concise explanation of why optimistic locking isn't ideal for hotel bookings and what works better:

Problem with Optimistic Locking:
- High contention for popular rooms
- Multiple users competing simultaneously
- Many transaction rollbacks
- Poor user experience
- Complex compensation for payment reversals

Better Solution: Pessimistic Locking with Distributed Lock (Redis/ZooKeeper)

```java
// Core concept
try {
    // 1. Acquire distributed lock first
    if (acquireLock("room:123", timeout=30s)) {
        // 2. Verify availability
        // 3. Process payment
        // 4. Confirm booking
    }
} finally {
    // Always release lock
    releaseLock()
}
```

Why This Works Better:
1. Prevents double bookings definitively
2. Clear success/failure states
3. No complex rollback needed
4. Better user experience
5. Similar to airline/theater booking systems

Trade-offs:
```
Advantages:
- Guaranteed consistency
- Simpler error handling
- Clear user feedback

Disadvantages:
- Slightly higher latency
- Lock management overhead
```

Real-world Example:
```
User A (India) → Gets lock → Books room
User B (US) → Sees "Currently being booked" → Clear feedback
```

This approach is industry-standard because it prioritizes booking consistency over minor latency costs, which is crucial for hotel reservation systems.

### What type of tables can be stored in NoSql and MySQL, based on usage patterns. just give theory

I'll break down the database table distribution based on usage patterns and characteristics:

MySQL (Relational) Tables:

1. Transactional Data:
- Bookings/Reservations
- Payment Transactions
- User Accounts
- Hotel Partner Accounts
Rationale: ACID compliance needed, complex joins required, structured data

2. Financial Records:
- Invoices
- Refunds
- Commission Records
Rationale: Strong consistency required, regulatory compliance

3. Core Reference Data:
- Room Types
- Amenities Master
- Service Categories
Rationale: Infrequently changed, relationships important

NoSQL Tables:

1. Document Store (MongoDB/DynamoDB):
- Hotel Details (frequently updated)
- User Preferences
- Search History
- Reviews/Ratings
Rationale: Schema flexibility, high write throughput, no complex joins

2. Key-Value Store (Redis):
- Session Data
- Caching Layer
- Rate Limiting Data
- Real-time Room Availability
Rationale: Fast access, expiry needed, high throughput

3. Wide-Column Store (Cassandra):
- Logs
- Metrics
- Historical Pricing
- Booking Analytics
Rationale: Time-series data, high write throughput, scalability

4. Search Engine (Elasticsearch):
- Hotel Search Index
- Location Data
- Amenities Search
- Full-text Content
Rationale: Complex search queries, geospatial features

Usage Pattern Considerations:

1. Write-Heavy:
- NoSQL for logs, events, metrics
- Distributed databases for better write scaling

2. Read-Heavy:
- Caching layer with Redis
- Read replicas for MySQL

3. Complex Queries:
- MySQL for joins and transactions
- Elasticsearch for search operations

4. Real-time Data:
- Redis for immediate consistency
- Document stores for frequent updates

5. Analytics:
- Wide-column stores for time-series
- Data warehouses for complex analytics

This distribution optimizes for:
- Data consistency where needed
- Read/write performance
- Scalability requirements
- Query complexity
- Data structure flexibility
