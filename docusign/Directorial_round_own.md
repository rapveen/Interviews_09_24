It is 30mins round.
1. tell me about yourself
2. As you said about DB Schema changes. How did you migrate
    -> I mentioned what ever I've noted
    -> Asked like how did you make sure rollback strategies.
        ==> I said the old DB schema related collection is still there. no issue in rollbacking.
3. What is the most challenging project that you have handled?
    -> I said everything about the email delivery pipelines.
    -> I've listed the Challenges in the answer. So said that in less time.
4. He asked that how did I streamlined the kubernetes clusters. How did you do that?
    -> I referenced my answer from claude
    -> said htat I setup HPA based on metrics like CPU, memmory usage
    -> ensured efficient pod distribution across nodes
    -> etc. But plpease prepare for this one.
5. Asked myself some questions
    -> As it involved multiple works including platform, storage infrastructure, and runtime. does it have separate teams for individual scaling or single team. How it is operated.
    -> Do we follow a multi tenant architecture to store multiple company wide info.
    -> Inorder to isolate the data and also follow the compliance regulations how does it achieve that? smthng like PCI DSS compliance in payments.
6. In the end he asked like if you are okay in working internal teams specific job as you have worked till now as user facing SW.
    -> I mentioned my answer accordingly.
    => What truly drives me is seeing the ripple effect of infrastructure improvements â€“ how shaving minutes off deployment times or reducing system latency can translate into significant productivity gains across the organization. This role at DocuSign represents exactly the kind of impact I want to make in my next career step
    => worked on AWS CodeDeploy, pipeline setup for other teams too.
    

I felt it went well lets see.
